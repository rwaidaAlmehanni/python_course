#tuples is the same as array but it has () or without it and its has the same of array functions
#ex: a=(1,2,3) or a=1,2,3
# a  1,2,3
#len(a)  3
#a[1] 2
#a[1:] 2,3


#set: new way to saving list (collection) of data in ordered and none dupelcated way
#ex: x=set([1,2,6,3,2])
# set([1,2,3,6]) orderd and unique

# another way : x={1,4,3,1,2}   set([1,2,3,4])
# to add new data to the set :
# x={1,2,4,3} set([1,2,3,4])
#x.add(5) set([1,2,3,4,5])
# to test the element in the set using in 
# 1 in x
