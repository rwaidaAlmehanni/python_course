# Python has built-in functions min and max to compute minimum and maximum of a given list. Provide an implementation for these functions. What happens when you call your min and max functions with a list of strings?
# it give the min or the max of the length of every item
# ex:min("aaa","gh") # "gh" return the min length
#    max("aaa","gh") "aaa" return the max length
